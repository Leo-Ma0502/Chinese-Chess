# Multiplayer Chinese-Chess Game

## Brief

This project is focused on implementing an asynchronous server which enables multiple browser-based clients to play a simple Chinese Chess game paired in 2. The server side only uses standard socket class of .Net 7 and implements a simplified HTTP-REST to handle the requests from clients.

## How to run

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Leo-Ma0502/Chinese-Chess.git
```

Start the server (.NET 7 runtime required):

```
cd Server/AsyncServer
dotnet run
```

Open the HTML file in two different browsers. In each window, click register and join the game.
